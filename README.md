# BsApClient
Client for BcAppServer
You need NPM and Bower installed, after that run npm instal and bower install (in project directory)
to install project dependencies. Start the server (https://github.com/Jakub-Vacek/BcAppServer), publish HTML templates in Gulp-webserver (gulp serve in root directory).
